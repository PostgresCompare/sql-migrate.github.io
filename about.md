My name is Neil Anderson. I'm a software developer. I spent a large chunk of my career working on database comparison and deployment tools at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com). Now I work on [Postgres Compare](https://www.postgrescompare.com), a product that compares and deploys [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) databases.
